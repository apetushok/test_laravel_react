## FRONTEND
Using the backend API created in the backend test, build a web app to display the list of hotels.
The app should consist of an initial listing page displaying the name, image, city and stars for each hotel.
When clicking on a hotel it should go to a hotel detail page and show the hotel name, image, city, stars, address and description.
The design is completely up to you but don't worry too much about it, something very simple is fine. Feel free to use for example Material UI or bootstrap classes or any design template.
